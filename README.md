# Formula-1-Regressor-Model

For my final project I’m going to build a machine learning model using the Formula 1 World Championship (1950-2023) from kaggle. For my machine learning model I chose to build a model that could predict the amount of points a constructor would score in a season based on features such as grid position, laps per race, year, round, points, wins, and circuit. I chose very few features because I didn’t want the model to process too much data since most of it dates back to 1950 and there are multiple datasets so I didn’t want the dataset that the model was based on to be overly complicated. The dataset the model is based on is only made up of five datasets which are constructor_results, results, races, constructors, and constructor_standings.  I chose to have the dataset for the model be from the years 1961-1990 because during that time period Formula 1 used the same point system which gives the model a singular point system to work with. I did this because the model lacks the ability to comprehend the fact that there might be different points systems for different seasons. The type of model I used is a random forest regressor model because I need to use a regressor model in order to predict the outcome of the points for a constructor in a season and a random forest regressor is good for processing large datasets. My model ended up working out pretty well because it only had a mean squared error of 0.03878298701857356.
